# Introduction to the "standard-covoiturage"

Version fran√ßaise [disponible ici](./README.fr.md).

This repository presents the work of the "standard covoiturage" ("carpoling 
standard") working group. It brings together French carpooling and MaaS 
players.
 
The "standard covoiturage" is intended to describe reference methods for 
making data available, carrying out transactions and, more generally, enabling 
the exchange of services between carpooling operators and MaaS platforms.

To date, the standard is based on an
[OpenAPI specification](./standard-carpooling_openapi.yaml).
Additional documentation is being written (see the
[README of the "doc" directory](./doc/README.md)).

The standard is published in an informative version, to allow an experimentation 
experimentation before publication in a normative version. As such, it is may be subject to changes that are not backward compatible.

Publication in normative version is planned for the end of 2022.
